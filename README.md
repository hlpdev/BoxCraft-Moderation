# BoxCraft Moderation

This mod is geared towards BoxCraft's moderation team. It allows them to use an in-game GUI for managing players.
It gives moderators the ability to warn, mute, kick, and ban players, go into vanish mode, switch between
spectator and survival, view players inventories, view player information, view past infractions, all from within an
in-game GUI.
